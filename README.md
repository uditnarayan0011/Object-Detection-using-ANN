# Object-Detection-using-ANN
Designed an object detection system using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to identify and localize objects within images. The model predicts bounding boxes and assigns confidence ratings based on recognition accuracy. Demonstrated foundational skills in object detection and recognition, with potential for enhancement using advanced architectures.
